# Strapi MCP Test Fixes Summary

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Component Update - DisplayName Required Error
- **Issue**: Component update failing with "displayName.required" validation error
- **Fix**: Enhanced the component update logic to properly extract displayName from multiple possible paths in the component data structure
- **File**: `/src/api/components.ts` (lines 230-237)
- **Changes**:
  - Added multiple fallback paths for extracting displayName
  - Added JSON stringification for proper payload logging
  - Added debug logging for component data structure

### 2. Media Upload - "Files are empty" Error  
- **Issue**: Media uploads failing with "Files are empty" validation error when using strapiClient
- **Fix**: Removed the default `Content-Type: application/json` header when uploading FormData
- **File**: `/src/api/media.ts` (lines 102-108)
- **Changes**:
  - Modified upload to explicitly remove Content-Type header
  - Let axios automatically set the correct multipart/form-data boundary

### 3. ECONNRESET Errors in Media Upload
- **Issue**: Media uploads failing with ECONNRESET when Strapi restarts
- **Fix**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- **File**: `/src/api/media.ts` (lines 70-93)
- **Changes**:
  - Added performUpload helper with retry logic
  - Handles both ECONNRESET and ECONNREFUSED errors
  - Implements exponential backoff between retries

### 4. Rate Limiting (429) Errors in Admin Authentication
- **Issue**: Multiple rapid login attempts causing 429 rate limit errors
- **Fix**: Implemented rate limiting protection and retry logic
- **File**: `/src/api/client.ts` (lines 44-124)
- **Changes**:
  - Added minimum 2-second delay between login attempts
  - Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff for 429 errors
  - Respects retry-after header when available

### 5. Connection Refused Errors Due to Strapi Restart
- **Issue**: Tests failing when Strapi auto-restarts after component creation/update
- **Fix**: Added wait mechanism for Strapi to come back online
- **Files**: `/src/api/components.ts` (createComponent and updateComponent methods)
- **Changes**:
  - Added health check polling after component operations
  - Waits up to 30 seconds for Strapi to restart
  - Only applies in development mode

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Test Environment Timing Issues
Some tests are still failing with "Connection refused" because:
- Strapi is shutting down at the end of the test suite
- Tests are running after Strapi has stopped
- This appears to be a test environment/timing issue rather than a code issue

### 2. Component Paginated Retrieval
The test expects an "attributes" property on components returned by the paginated endpoint, but this might not be included in the list response.

### 3. Error Message Expectations
Several error handling tests are expecting specific error messages that have changed due to the connection refused errors.

## Recommendations

1. **Test Environment**: Consider adding a global test setup/teardown to ensure Strapi stays running throughout all tests
2. **Component Tests**: May need to adjust test expectations for paginated component responses
3. **Error Tests**: Update error message expectations to match the actual error responses
